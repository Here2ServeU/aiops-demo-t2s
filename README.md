# AIOps Demo: Express Web App + AI-Assisted Remediation

## **Welcome to the AIOps Transformation Demo**

In today’s tech landscape, the most valuable engineers aren't just those who can build a website—they are the ones who can keep it running automatically. This project is a real-world demonstration of **AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations)**.

### **What is this?**

This repository provides a complete, "push-button" environment that simulates a professional Cloud Engineering ecosystem. You will move from manual troubleshooting to **automated, AI-assisted remediation**.

### **Why does this matter for your career?**

* **High-Demand Skills:** Master the "Big Three" of modern operations: **Docker** (Infrastructure), **Prometheus/Grafana** (Observability), and **Python** (Automation).
* **Six-Figure Roadmap:** Companies are shifting toward automated AIOps. Learning these tools puts you on the fast track to becoming a high-earning Cloud or Site Reliability Engineer (SRE).
* **Zero to Hero:** You don't need a math degree or a lifelong coding background. This demo proves that with the right roadmap, you can manage complex systems with simple, powerful commands.

2. **Configure Environment:**
`cp .env.example .env` (Edit `.env` to add your `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`).
3. **Start the Stack:**
```bash
docker compose up -d --build

```


4. **Access Services:**
* **App:** http://localhost:3000

### **The Evolution: Scaling to the AWS Cloud**

While this demo runs locally using Docker Compose, real-world AIOps scales using AWS managed services. Here is how this platform evolves as you grow:

* **ECR (Amazon Elastic Container Registry):** Instead of keeping images on your local machine, we move them to **ECR**. This is a secure, private "cloud library" for your Docker images, ensuring they are always available for deployment.
* **ECS (Amazon Elastic Container Service):** This is the next step up from Docker Compose. **ECS** manages your containers for you, automatically restarting them if they fail and handling the "heavy lifting" of running your Express app in a production environment.
* **EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service):** For maximum scale, we transition to **EKS**. This is the industry standard for managing thousands of containers. It provides the most advanced AIOps capabilities, allowing for complex, self-healing architectures that span across the globe.
